            <p>

                At Patravi Biotech, we are advancing the frontier of genomic medicine through next-generation gene editing tools such as
                CRISPR 2.0, base editing, and prime editing. Unlike earlier methods that relied on double-strand DNA breaks, these new
                techniques offer unprecedented precision—enabling the correction of single nucleotide mutations with minimized
                off-target effects. Our scientists are leveraging these tools to develop safer, more targeted therapies for a wide range
                of genetic conditions, from rare monogenic disorders to complex diseases like cancer. By refining the accuracy and
                versatility of gene editing, we are laying the groundwork for a new era of curative treatments.

    <br />


<br/>
One of the most critical challenges in gene therapy is delivering these powerful tools efficiently and safely into the
right cells. At Patravi Biotech, we are pioneering gene therapy delivery systems—including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs),
viral vectors such as AAVs, and cell-specific targeting platforms—that are optimized for in vivo and ex vivo
applications. Our research extends into RNA therapeutics, where we are developing siRNA, mRNA, and self-replicating RNA
technologies not only for infectious diseases but also for previously untreatable cancers, rare diseases, and autoimmune
conditions. These delivery innovations are vital to translating laboratory breakthroughs into real-world treatments.
    <br /><br />

    The next wave of genomic innovation is not just scientific—it's strategic. With regulatory frameworks evolving and
    delivery bottlenecks being addressed, investors are increasingly focused on companies that can demonstrate both
    technological depth and clinical scalability. Patravi Biotech’s integrated approach—combining gene editing innovation
    with advanced delivery and RNA therapeutic pipelines—positions us as a leader in this fast-moving space. As we move
    toward first-in-human trials and scalable platforms, we offer a compelling value proposition for investors seeking to
    back transformative therapies with high-impact potential and long-term growth trajectories.

            <h3 class="about-content-h3"> Drug Discovery and Development</h3>
            <p>
                One major focus at Patravi is the identification and development of new
                therapeutics. Patravi’s scientists use high-throughput screening, computational modeling,
                and molecular assays to
                identify potential drug candidates.
                These compounds are tested for their ability to interact with<span class="content-blue"> specific
                    molecular
                    targets to modulate disease-related pathways </span>. Once promising compounds
                are identified, researchers
                analyze their pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy in model organisms before
                clinical trials.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about-content-h3">Genomics and Precison Medicine</h3>
            <p>
                Patravi’s advancements in genomics have revolutionized the way our researchers approach medicine. Our
                Scientists utilize
                techniques such as <span class="content-blue">next-generation sequencing (NGS), CRISPR, and
                    transcriptomic
                    analysis </span> to study genetic variations and
                their contributions to diseases. Genomic research allows for the development of treatments tailored to
                individuals based
                on their genetic makeup, minimizing adverse effects and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-content-h3">Disease Mechanisms and Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                Patravi understands the molecular basis of diseases is essential for developing effective treatments and
                preventative
                measures. Researchers study <span class="content-blue">cellular signaling pathways, epigenetics, and
                    protein
                    interactions to uncover the root
                    causes </span> of conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.
                By identifying biomarkers,
                scientists can develop diagnostic tools that detect diseases at earlier stages, allowing for more
                effective
                intervention. -->
