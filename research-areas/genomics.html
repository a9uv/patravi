              <strong style=" font-size: 1.25rem;color: #2583e8; font-family: 'Gemunu Libre', sans-serif;">Scientific Landscape:</strong> Gene editing has entered a new era beyond traditional CRISPR-Cas9.
                Next-generation tools like base editors (e.g., cytosine and adenine base editors) and prime editors provide
                unmatched precision by enabling single-nucleotide edits without introducing double-strand breaks. This mitigates the
                risk of off-target effects and large-scale genomic rearrangements, making these tools more suitable for clinical
                applications. The advent of programmable RNA-guided editors also facilitates more predictable and safer therapeutic
                interventions.
                <br><br>
            
                <strong style=" font-size: 1.25rem;color: #2583e8; font-family: 'Gemunu Libre', sans-serif;">Delivery Challenges:</strong> Despite their potential, the full therapeutic value of gene editing
                technologies remains contingent upon delivery. In vivo editing requires efficient, cell-specific transport of gene
                editing machinery. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and emerging non-viral vectors
                (e.g., engineered exosomes) are being developed to overcome biological barriers. Companies like Verve Therapeutics
                are pioneering LNP-based cardiovascular therapies, while Beam Therapeutics is advancing multiplex editing for sickle
                cell and thalassemia.

                <strong style=" font-size: 1.25rem;color: #2583e8; font-family: 'Gemunu Libre', sans-serif;">Market & Pipeline:</strong> According to BIS Research, the global gene editing market is projected to
                surpass $20 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 30%+. Over 100 active CRISPR-based therapies are in various stages
                of development globally. Concurrently, RNA therapeutics have expanded post-COVID, with more than 250 active clinical
                programs in siRNA, mRNA, and self-amplifying RNA. Platforms such as Moderna, Arcturus, and Alnylam are now pushing
                RNA beyond vaccines into rare diseases, oncology, and immune modulation.

                <strong style=" font-size: 1.25rem;color: #2583e8; font-family: 'Gemunu Libre', sans-serif;">Investment Relevance:</strong> Investors are targeting dual-platform companies that combine proprietary
                editing enzymes with novel delivery mechanisms. The potential for milestone payments and licensing deals with large
                pharma is substantial. Delivery-focused startups are particularly attractive due to their horizontal applicability
                across multiple disease states.

            <p>

                At Patravi Biotech, we are advancing the frontier of genomic medicine through next-generation gene editing tools such as
                CRISPR 2.0, base editing, and prime editing. Unlike earlier methods that relied on double-strand DNA breaks, these new
                techniques offer unprecedented precision—enabling the correction of single nucleotide mutations with minimized
                off-target effects. Our scientists are leveraging these tools to develop safer, more targeted therapies for a wide range
                of genetic conditions, from rare monogenic disorders to complex diseases like cancer. By refining the accuracy and
                versatility of gene editing, we are laying the groundwork for a new era of curative treatments.

    <br />


<br/>
One of the most critical challenges in gene therapy is delivering these powerful tools efficiently and safely into the
right cells. At Patravi Biotech, we are pioneering gene therapy delivery systems—including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs),
viral vectors such as AAVs, and cell-specific targeting platforms—that are optimized for in vivo and ex vivo
applications. Our research extends into RNA therapeutics, where we are developing siRNA, mRNA, and self-replicating RNA
technologies not only for infectious diseases but also for previously untreatable cancers, rare diseases, and autoimmune
conditions. These delivery innovations are vital to translating laboratory breakthroughs into real-world treatments.
    <br /><br />

    The next wave of genomic innovation is not just scientific—it's strategic. With regulatory frameworks evolving and
    delivery bottlenecks being addressed, investors are increasingly focused on companies that can demonstrate both
    technological depth and clinical scalability. Patravi Biotech’s integrated approach—combining gene editing innovation
    with advanced delivery and RNA therapeutic pipelines—positions us as a leader in this fast-moving space. As we move
    toward first-in-human trials and scalable platforms, we offer a compelling value proposition for investors seeking to
    back transformative therapies with high-impact potential and long-term growth trajectories.
