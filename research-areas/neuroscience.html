            <p>

                At Patravi Biotech, we are redefining the frontier of neurotechnology by developing sophisticated human-machine
                interfaces that bridge the gap between neural activity and digital systems. Our research focuses on advancing both
                invasive and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), enabling direct communication between the brain and external
                devices. These technologies hold transformative potential in clinical contexts—from restoring communication for
                individuals with ALS to enabling motor control in patients with paralysis. By integrating neural signal processing,
                adaptive algorithms, and cutting-edge materials, we are creating interfaces that are not only more responsive but also
                safer and more scalable for real-world applications.
<br /><br />
As neurotechnology matures beyond its experimental origins, Patravi Biotech is driving its evolution into impactful,
real-world solutions. Our non-invasive neuromodulation platforms and neuro-AI systems are tailored to address complex
neurological conditions such as depression, epilepsy, and cognitive decline. Simultaneously, we are developing
consumer-grade technologies that promote neurofitness, focus enhancement, and immersive gaming experiences—blending
neuroscience with lifestyle and performance. The convergence of clinical efficacy and consumer usability opens up a
dual-pathway for value creation, attracting both healthcare stakeholders and next-generation tech adopters.
<br /><br />
The neurotechnology landscape is entering a pivotal phase of growth, marked by regulatory progress, accelerating R&D,
and tangible clinical breakthroughs. Investors are recognizing the shift from speculative hype to viable, scalable
solutions—especially in areas like personalized brain therapies, wearable neurointerfaces, and AI-enhanced diagnostic
tools. At Patravi Biotech, our strategic focus aligns with this momentum: we are building technologies that not only
meet critical medical needs but also resonate with consumer trends and enterprise applications. This dual-track
innovation positions us—and our investors—at the intersection of neuroscience, digital health, and next-gen human
augmentation.

                prevention, and genomic medicine. We employ <span class="content-blue">cutting edge techniques and tools
                </span> to investigate
                the mechanisms underlying cellular function, gene expression, and biochemical interactions.

            <h3 class="about-content-h3"> Drug Discovery and Development</h3>
            <p>
                One major focus at Patravi is the identification and development of new
                therapeutics. Patravi’s scientists use high-throughput screening, computational modeling,
                and molecular assays to
                identify potential drug candidates.
                These compounds are tested for their ability to interact with<span class="content-blue"> specific
                    molecular
                    targets to modulate disease-related pathways </span>. Once promising compounds
                are identified, researchers
                analyze their pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy in model organisms before
                clinical trials.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about-content-h3">Genomics and Precison Medicine</h3>
            <p>
                Patravi’s advancements in genomics have revolutionized the way our researchers approach medicine. Our
                Scientists utilize
                techniques such as <span class="content-blue">next-generation sequencing (NGS), CRISPR, and
                    transcriptomic
                    analysis </span> to study genetic variations and
                their contributions to diseases. Genomic research allows for the development of treatments tailored to
                individuals based
                on their genetic makeup, minimizing adverse effects and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-content-h3">Disease Mechanisms and Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                Patravi understands the molecular basis of diseases is essential for developing effective treatments and
                preventative
                measures. Researchers study <span class="content-blue">cellular signaling pathways, epigenetics, and
                    protein
                    interactions to uncover the root
                    causes </span> of conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.
                By identifying biomarkers,
                scientists can develop diagnostic tools that detect diseases at earlier stages, allowing for more
                effective
                intervention. -->
