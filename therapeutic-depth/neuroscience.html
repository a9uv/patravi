            <h3 class="about-content-h3"> Drug Discovery and Development</h3>
            <p>
                One major focus at Patravi is the identification and development of new
                therapeutics. Patravi’s scientists use high-throughput screening, computational modeling,
                and molecular assays to
                identify potential drug candidates.
                These compounds are tested for their ability to interact with<span class="content-blue"> specific
                    molecular
                    targets to modulate disease-related pathways </span>. Once promising compounds
                are identified, researchers
                analyze their pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy in model organisms before
                clinical trials.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about-content-h3">Genomics and Precison Medicine</h3>
            <p>
                Patravi’s advancements in genomics have revolutionized the way our researchers approach medicine. Our
                Scientists utilize
                techniques such as <span class="content-blue">next-generation sequencing (NGS), CRISPR, and
                    transcriptomic
                    analysis </span> to study genetic variations and
                their contributions to diseases. Genomic research allows for the development of treatments tailored to
                individuals based
                on their genetic makeup, minimizing adverse effects and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-content-h3">Disease Mechanisms and Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                Patravi understands the molecular basis of diseases is essential for developing effective treatments and
                preventative
                measures. Researchers study <span class="content-blue">cellular signaling pathways, epigenetics, and
                    protein
                    interactions to uncover the root
                    causes </span> of conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.
                By identifying biomarkers,
                scientists can develop diagnostic tools that detect diseases at earlier stages, allowing for more
                effective
                intervention. -->
